# MCIntegrator++

C++ Library for computing numerical integrals with the Monte Carlo method.
Some basic tools for finding the average and standard deviation of an array of data are included.

In `doc/` there is a user manual in pdf.

In `examples/` there are several examples (STILL TO BE DONE).



# Build the library

Insert the system parameters in a file named `config.sh` (use `config_template.sh` as template) and then simply execute the command

   `./build.sh`
