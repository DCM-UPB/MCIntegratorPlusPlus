# LEGEND OF THE UNIT TESTS


## Unit Test 1

`ut1/`: check that calling the integrator again without doing the findMRT2step and initialDecorrelation gives the same results.

## Unit Test 2

`ut2/`: Like ut1, but with one one-dimensional and one three-dimensional observable.

## Unit Test 3

`ut3/`: Like ut1, but checking with fixed number of findMRT2step/decorrelation steps and fixed blocking technique
